# Welcome to my-brain

Your vault is ready. Here's what you can do:

## Quick Start

- **Capture a thought:** `clawvault capture "your note here"`
- **Store structured memory:** `clawvault store --category decisions --title "My Choice" --content "..."`
- **Search your vault:** `clawvault search "query"`
- **See your knowledge graph:** `clawvault graph`
- **Get context for a topic:** `clawvault context "topic"`

## Vault Structure

Your vault organizes memories by type — decisions, lessons, people, projects, and more.
Each category is a folder. Each memory is a markdown file with frontmatter.

## Observational Memory

When connected to an AI agent (like OpenClaw), your vault can automatically observe
conversations and extract important memories — decisions, lessons, commitments — without
manual effort.

## Wiki-Links

Use `[[double brackets]]` to link between notes. Your memory graph tracks these
connections, building a knowledge network that grows with you.
