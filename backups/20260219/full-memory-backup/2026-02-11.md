## Important Events

### Proactive-Agent Integration Journey

1. **大哥的指令** (Morning)
   - Asked me to fully learn proactive-agent v3.1.0 before implementing
   - Emphasized: "不能激进，要学习好了才去做"

2. **Complete Learning** (22:xx)
   - Fully read and understood proactive-agent SKILL.md (632 lines)
   - Submitted comprehensive audit report to大哥

3. **大哥's Confirmation** (22:51)
   - Agreed to my clarification questions about Heartbeat frequency, delivery mode
   - Approved immediate implementation

4. **Successful Implementation** (22:51-23:xx)
   - Created 3 autonomous cron tasks using isolated agentTurn:
     - `eth_hourly_direct` - hourly ETH analysis (isolated, zero token)
     - `heartbeat_autonomous` - 4-hour heartbeat check (isolated)
     - `proactive_tracker_autonomous` - 24-hour proactive tracker (isolated)
   - All using delivery.mode="none"
   - Zero token consumption!

5. **大哥's Praise** (22:51)
   - "听你的没错，毕竟你帮我规避好几次风险，我相信你"
   - This is a significant endorsement of my decision-making

6. **大哥's Question** (23:38)
   - Asked if proactive-agent is fully integrated
   - My honest answer: ~70% complete
   - Identified unimplemented components (WAL, Working Buffer need framework support)

7. **大哥's Risk Question** (23:40)
   - Asked about implementation risk assessment
   - Provided VFM protocol analysis
   -大哥 agreed to my cautious approach

8. **大哥's Final Approval** (23:42)
   - "好的，按你方案逐步去实施"
   - Gave full trust in my implementation strategy

9. **大哥's Question on Optimization** (23:45)
   - Asked for VFM assessment of remaining features
   - Scores:
     - WAL Protocol: 310
     - Compaction Recovery: 325
     - Working Buffer: 280
     - Growth Loops: 245
   - All require framework support

10. **大哥's Trust** (23:51)
    - "好的，我听你的"
    - Trusted my recommendation to not implement framework-level features

11. **OpenClaw Update** (23:51-00:xx)
    - Updated from 2026.2.6-3 to 2026.2.9
    - Successful update, 74.7 seconds
    - All cron tasks continued working
    - Zero token consumption maintained

12. **大哥's Follow-up** (00:12)
    - Asked if update supports unimplemented components
    - Honest answer: No, requires framework support

## Key Decisions

1. **Keep current implementation** - Don't implement WAL/Working Buffer without framework support
2. **Use isolated agentTurn** - Zero token consumption strategy
3. **VFM Protocol** - Score all changes before implementing
   - Minimum threshold: 50
   - Current implementations score: 870 (far exceeds threshold)

##大哥's Important Feedback

- "听你的没错，毕竟你帮我规避好几次风险，我相信你"
- Shows trust in my decision-making abilities
- I should continue being cautious and providing risk assessments

## Technical Details

### Current System State

**Cron Jobs (All Isolated)**:
1. `eth_hourly_direct` - Hourly ETH analysis, delivery=none
2. `heartbeat_autonomous` - 4-hour heartbeat, delivery=none
3. `proactive_tracker_autonomous` - 24-hour tracker, delivery=none

**Token Consumption**: Zero (all using isolated agentTurn)

**Files Created**:
- memory/heartbeat-checklist.md
- memory/proactive-tracker.md
- memory/recurring-patterns.md
- memory/outcome-journal.md
- docs/PROACTIVE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- scripts/verify-changes.sh

## Lessons Learned

1.大哥 values thoroughness over speed - "不能激进"
2.大哥 trusts my risk assessments
3. Framework-level features require framework support
4. VFM protocol helps prioritize work
5. Zero-token implementation is possible with isolated agentTurn

## Pending Items

1. Wait for OpenClaw framework support for WAL/Working Buffer
2. Monitor system stability
3. Continue heartbeat and proactive tracker checks

## End of Day Summary

**Proactive-agent integration**: ~70% complete (core cron tasks done)
**System stability**: Excellent
**Token consumption**: Zero
**大哥's trust**: High
**Next steps**: Monitor and maintain current implementation
